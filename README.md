# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically within flexbox layouts and with incompatible units. 

**Bug:** Incorrect usage of `calc()` can lead to unexpected rendering issues. Incompatibility of units within the `calc()` function also causes errors. The detailed code can be found in `bug.css`. 

**Solution:** Ensure the `calc()` function is used correctly by only combining compatible units and verifying that the calculation is accurate for intended behavior in the context of the element's layout (e.g. flexbox). The solution with fixed code is found in `bugSolution.css`.
