The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly resulting in unexpected behavior.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not work as expected if the parent container's size depends on its content. Another example is using `calc()` with units that are incompatible, like `calc(100px + 10em)`.  The browser might interpret this as invalid, rendering the element incorrectly or not at all.
